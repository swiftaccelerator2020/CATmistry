CATmistry was built to aid upper primary to lower secondary school students in
their Chemistry learning journey. As many other Chemistry apps currently present
in the market cater largely to the undergrad/professional market, we find that
there is a lack of such apps tailored to the needs of the younger population.
CATmistry aims to convey relatively simple Chemistry concepts in a simple and
concise manner that would be the most suitable for our target age group.
Alongside the learn and information sections are mini-games and interactive
elements to provide for a fun and engaging learning experience.

CATmistry was built as part of our project for the Swift Accelerators'
Programme.
